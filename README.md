Vizia offers users an efficient tool to identify signs of potential eye disease or infection. Through a combination of health questionnaires and facial eye photo analysis, the app uses machine learning to detect symptoms associated with common eye conditions. Our app has implemented key features to detect eye diseases and infections by uploading photos.
